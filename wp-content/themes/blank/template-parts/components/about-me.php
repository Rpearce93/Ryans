				<p>My degree gave me quite a broad range of web development topics to develop on, ranging from Computer Science to IOS App Development, but the work I really enjoy is Front-End Web Development. I've never been a particularly good drawer, but with code I can build a website like a painter, paints a canvas. Not only does Front-End Development give me a chance to build a website that everyone can enjoy, but the logic and programming side of development is incredibly fun and rewarding; its literally the best of both worlds, incorporating logic and creativity.</p>

				<p>Front-End Development is an ever changing landscape of updates, new technologies and learning. This suites me perfectly as I love to learn a new skill or technology and put it into practice. Although I have someway to go, I hope to acquire Full Stack Developer status, specializing in JavaScript and whatever new and exciting innovations come within the next 5 years! A jack of all trades, and a master of everything.</p>
